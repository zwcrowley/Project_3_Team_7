Project 3 for UMN Data Bootcamp for Team 7

## **Team 7- Project 3 Proposal**: 
#### **Team members:** Juan Marin, James Lamotte, Zack Crowley, Matusola Bein 

The question that we would like to investigate is “do counties that are more prone to natural disasters have lower house prices?”. In order to answer this question we are first going to create a map of the United States with two layers, one that depicts the house prices and another layer that shows the risk of natural disaster. This will help visualize if there is a relationship between county house prices and risk of natural disasters. 

The data that we will use to create this map will be the Home Prices dataset 
from Kaggle (this dataset shows the home prices per county for the United states)  and the national risk index data set from resilience.climate.gov. (this dataset shows the risk level for counties in the united states). We will also  use the Kaggle zipcode-county dataset in order to properly convert zipcodes to counties for both datasets to merge.  

## Visualizations: 

- 1. United States Map with two layers (the home prices by county, risk level by county)

- 2. Scatterplot Regression graph (per state) that would present regression graph when hovering above the state on map.

- 3. A reactive bar graph that, when a county is clicked on the map, will display the natural risk level for the following: drought, heat wave, hurricanes, coastal + river flooding, lightning, tornadoes, wildfires, and winter weather.
